# Cities: Skylines 2 Mod - SPEEDUP!

    Lets make a "CS2: Lite Version" :0)

# Features and Usage
    
   
    Disable or modify some "luxury" vanilla systems that don't affect normal simulation but consume a lot of performance, better free up your CPU and graphics card, and save your electricity and air conditioning bills
    Thanks to the flexible mechanics of Unity ECS, moving out of these systems doesn't affect normal gameplay in the slightest, just a little less fun, and just a little :-)

# Compatibility and Known Issues

- Modified System: All of the pet-related System(cute dogs shouldn't have to suffer here :), TrafficSpawnAISystem,    . (Depending on the options)
- Compatibility : 
- Compatible with most mods . 
- Issues : welcome to submit issues in Github https://github.com/Noel-leoN/LandValueRemake

# Next Plan
