		## Cities: Skylines 2 Mod - CS2LiteBooster beta

		Lets make a "CS2: Lite Version" :0)

		## Features and Usage

		Disable or modify some "luxury" vanilla systems that don't affect normal simulation but consume a lot of CPU or GPU performance, will better free up your CPU and graphics card, and save your electricity and air conditioning bills
		Thanks to the flexible mechanics of Unity ECS, moving out of these systems doesn't affect normal gameplay in the slightest, just a little less fun, or just a little :-)

		## Compatibility and Known Issues

		- Modified System: All of the pet-related System(cute dogs shouldn't have to suffer here :), TrafficSpawnAISystem,    . (Depending on the options)
		- Compatibility :Compatible with most mods .
		- Being tested for serious side effects.
		- Issues : welcome to submit issues in Github https://github.com/Noel-leoN/CS2LiteBooster

		## Next Plan

		- Find more content to rip.

		## Changelog

		## Notice
		- Strongly recommand save your game data before use this mod. (Although most of the time there will be no problems)
